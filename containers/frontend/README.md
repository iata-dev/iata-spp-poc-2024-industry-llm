# IATA LLM Project - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a modern web application built as a Proof of Concept (POC) for IATA's Industry LLM initiative. The project implements an intelligent document validation system with an intuitive user interface. The core functionality revolves around document processing and validation.

## Key Business Flow

### 1. Document Submission

- Users can upload documents through file selection or direct camera capture
- Supported formats include images and PDF documents
- Multiple document upload capability for batch processing

### 2. Intelligent Validation Process

- Documents are transmitted to a backend service for validation
- The system employs LLM (Large Language Model) technology to analyze document content
- Simulated validation status feedback is provided to users

### 3. Dynamic Requirements Management

- Upon document validation, the system generates a list of additional required documents
- Clear success/error status indicators guide users through the process
- Interactive checklist of pending document requirements

### 4. Completion Workflow

- The validation process tracks the submission of all required documents
- Automatic status updates as each document requirement is fulfilled
- Final confirmation when all necessary documentation is successfully validated
